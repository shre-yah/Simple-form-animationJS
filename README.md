### What is happening

- Takes username, Email, Password page wise
- If filled in wrong input, changes background color and shake
- Goes to next input only when filled in correct form

### Improvements that could be made (might do)
- Keeping all input field on same page, where fields are locked until user insert correct input in precedence field.
- Make some background animations, too plain rightnow.
- Make users known about the formats of fileds and when filled wrong tell user about changes it need.
